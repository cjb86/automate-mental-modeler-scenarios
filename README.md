# Automate Mental Modeler Scenarios: Run Exhaustive Combinations with Minimal Effort
An example of automating running factorial combinations of defined scenarios in the fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) application, Mental Modeler.

In order to use the automation script, you must have access to Mental Modeler. If you find yourself in a situation where you would benefit from fuzzy cognitive mapping, then you can fill out the information on the following page to request access: https://www.mentalmodeler.com/

Once you have access to Mental Modeler, you must create a model and define linkages.
After creating a model, you need to define the scenarios that you are trying to run.
You will then need to edit the script to define those scenarios.
After editing the script, it can be uploaded into the browser using the browser console, which can be accessed by clicking F12.
Simply paste the entire script into the browser console and hit Enter.
Then type runScenarios() and hit Enter again to start the script.

After the scenarios have finished running, the results will be printed in the browser console where you can copy them.
